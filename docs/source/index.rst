Welcome to Sovr Protocol's documentation!
=========================================

**Sovr Protocol** integrates the *Golem network*'s compute prowess into the *FairOS-DFS* and the *Swarm network*'s storage facilities. The whole idea revolves around the concept of compute pods. A compute pod is simply a set of files that define how a *Golem* task should run, what are the inputs, outputs, and finally where the logs are going to be held. All these files are finally stored in decentralized storage of the *FaiOS-DFS* and *Swarm*. The tool that is in charge of persisting, sharing, and running compute pods is called the **Sovr CLI**.

To get your feet wet,check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information about how to get started with the CLI and necessary :ref:`prerequisites` setup. To deep dive into the builiding blocks of the **Sover Protocol**, you can take a look at the :doc:`computepods` section.
