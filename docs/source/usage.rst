To get the Sovr CLI, just fork it from its Github repository:

.. code-block:: console

   git clone https://github.com/LickliderCircle/sovr.git

Prerequisites
-------------
There are few steps that need to be done before using the CLI:

- To setup the Swarm node please consult `https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/`, please note that setting up a Swarm node would be easier using provided binaries. Set up the your node, fund your wallet(you can request funds from Swarm discord), deploy chequebooks and bingo! 
- To setup the FairOS-DFS, please consult `https://docs.fairos.fairdatasociety.org/docs/fairOS-dfs/introduction`, remember that the version `0.7.3` of binaries is the recommended version.
- To setup Golem, please consult `https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development`.
Now that you have a working environment for Swarm, FairOS-DFS, and Golem, it is time to start using the Sovr CLI.
